This project was completed as part of the requirements for the Jan-Mar 2021 Full Stack Javascript course through Code Louisville. The project itself is a very commonly needed feature in various web platforms: a user data entry table. The unit of analysis in this data is renewable energy projects. While using this app, pretend you are an energy purchaser trying to keep track of renewable energy contracts. The technical requirements for the Code Louisville course are outlined in the table below:

Build at least three routes | Have routes made to create a project, read and render all the projects in the database on the page, update a project using the editing feature, and delete a project using the delete button on each row
Each endpoint must have at least one meaningful unit test (so minimum of three tests) | Have set up unit tests for each endpoint
